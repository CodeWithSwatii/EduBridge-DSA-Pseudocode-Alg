# EduBridge DSA â€“ Pseudocode and Algorithms

This repository contains basic data structures and algorithm problems along with their step-by-step **algorithms** and **pseudocode**.

These were prepared as part of the EduBridge learning program to strengthen my understanding of logic building, problem solving, and coding fundamentals.
